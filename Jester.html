    <title>Information about Jester</title>
    <h2>INFO: Jester    (120% zoom reccomended)</h2>
        <p>Known as: "The Jester"</p>
        <p>Purpose: Guarding The Bridge</p>
        <p>Personality: Interacts with people only if they will answer The Jester's riddles, which if you get one of his riddles correctly, he will grant you access to pass through his bridge and be friendly towards you.</p>
        <p>Where he spawns: On the bridge</p>
        <h3>Attack Patterns For Those Who Want To Kill Him To Advance In The Mission</h3>
        <p>-  Regular attack; In this attack, he starts sprinting towards you with both of his arms extended forward like a zombie. You can easily scare him off if you keep attacking him with your sword.</p>
        <p>-  Dismantle; In this attack, his legs and arms will all be disassembled and start floating around his body within a 360 angle. When he does this, he walks away from you to try and get you from a range since in this attack, if you don't cancel it out by attacking him in time, he will fling you by looking at you while doing this attack.</p>
        <p>-  Fireball; He will prepare a flaming attack to send down as a projectile on his enemy. This projectile goes very slowly. Upon touching the projectile, you will get damaged and possibly flung. You have to run away from this attack when you see it until it runs out.</p>
        
        <h3>DODGES</h3>
        
        <p>-Regular evasion; He will move away from your attacks.</p>
        <p>-Acrobatics; He will dash forward, above from your head to gain more distance.</p>
        <p>-Teleportation; He teleports all over the area each time you try to land a hit on him, while doing the "L Dance" on you. Just keep attacking to exhaust this attack. He usually does this when he needs to buy more time for his other attacks to charge up.</p>
        <p>-Shield; He can summon a shield on his torso which will block ANY attacks. When you see him with his shield, wait for the right moment to try and break the shield from a safe distance, aka. when he is not attacking you since it is like a free invincibility frame for him and it can be pretty abusive.</p>
        
        <h3>How you can damage him?</h3>
        
        <p>-The way he takes damage is quite the trick here. You can't damage him directly but you can take his limbs out one by one. Starting off from his leg to both of his legs, his arm to both of his arms and eventually his body and head. In total, he has a HP of 600 if we reckon all his body parts that keeps him going. Just continue slicing him up until there is none of him left.</p>
        
        <h3>Passive abilities</h3>
        <p>-He can regenerate his body parts simply by staying on either of the gold blocks located around the map. You need to be quick with your attacks and keep chasing him down without giving him any opportunity to heal himself after getting killed by him. It takes approximately a minute for him to gain a body part by standing still on any of the gold blocks.</p>
        <p>-He can transform himself into a little plushy. The reason he does this is because he tries to cause distraction and buy time for himself to head for a safe spot to heal himself in. By chance you see any plushy floating around in the map somewhere, go ahead and immediately catch it and destroy it as it is the jester himself inside that doll who is trying to run away from you.</p>
        <p>+Plus sides: He will lose several abilities as you advance in the battle. For example, he will lose his "Acrobatics" move once you take out both of his legs, he will lose his "Fireball" attack once you destroy one of his arms after the 2 legs and he will not be able to do anything but to run after you take out both of his legs and arms until he can come up with one final line of defense by trying to regain his body parts.</p>
        
        <h3>Final segment.</h3>
        <p>"-I don't trust this Jester guy. He is quite the trickster. Once I had taken out 4 of his limbs, he stopped and started talking to me. He said several things. He stated that he was feeling regretful and sorry for his actions and that he asked to be spared. It wasn't until I fell for this trick that he went away and healed himself fully then came back and confronted me in his full potential like the first time we initiated the battle. Do NOT listen to this clown, he doesn't deserve any mercy. He will try to lure you in to listen to his fake pleading."</p>
